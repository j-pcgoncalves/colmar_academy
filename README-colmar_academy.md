## Overview

### The challenge

Build the landing page of Colmar Academy.


### Links

- Live Site URL: [Colmar Academy](https://j-pcgoncalves.github.io/colmar_academy/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Responsive Web Design for mobile

### What I learned

In this project i managed to further my knowledge in HTML and CSS, especially CSS Grid and how to use it better in a Web Page. The CSS Grid part was a bit more difficult but this project helped understand how to use it and build layouts for Websites.


### Continued development

In my future projects, i will be focusing especially in the @media queries and how i can create a good responsive Web Site for mobile, and i will be practicing the use of CSS Grid so i can implement it better in a Website's layout.
